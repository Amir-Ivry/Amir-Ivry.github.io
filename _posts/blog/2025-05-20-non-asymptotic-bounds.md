In evaluation, we want **guarantees** that hold at realistic sample sizes. Non-asymptotic bounds give usable confidence levels today, not in the limit. I outline how I’m using Hanson–Wright-type inequalities to bound errors for diffusion-map-based perceptual metrics, and what this means for weekly benchmarking.

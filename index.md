I’m a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of **speech**, **audio perception**, and **machine learning**. I build evaluation methods and metrics that connect signal processing with human perception, and I like turning theoretical results into working tools.

Right now I’m focusing on: diffusion maps for perceptual embeddings, confidence bounds for perceptual metrics, and practical tooling for reliable evaluation of speech separation and enhancement systems.
